# Bank Account Program

## About
This is a simple C++ program to manage a bank account. It allows you to:
- Check your balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money

## Why I Wrote This
I created this program to practice basic C++ skills like using classes, methods, and a simple menu system.

## How to Use
1. Compile the code: `g++ bankModified.cpp -o bank`
2. Run the program: `./bank`
3. Follow the menu to check your balance, deposit, or withdraw money.

## Starting Balance
The program starts with an initial balance of $1000.
